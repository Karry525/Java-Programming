Programming Exercise: Object Oriented Caesar Cipher
Assignment 1: One Key
In this assignment, you will put together the CaesarCipher class from the lesson and add a decrypt method to decrypt with the same key. In
addition you will create a second class, TestCaesarCipher to test examples that use the CaesarCipher class, including writing a method that
will automatically decrypt an encrypted file by determining the key and then decrypting with that key.

Assignment 2: Two Keys
In this assignment, you will put together the CaesarCipherTwo class that encrypts a message with two keys (the same way as the previous 
lesson: key1 is used to encrypt every other letter, starting with the first, and key2 is used to encrypt every other letter, starting with 
the second), and also decrypts the same message. In addition you will create a second class, TestCaesarCipherTwo to test examples that use 
the CaesarCipherTwo class, including writing a method that will automatically decrypt an encrypted file by determining the two keys that 
were used to encrypt it.
