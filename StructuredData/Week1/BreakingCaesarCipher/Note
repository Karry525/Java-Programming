Programming Exercise: Breaking the Caesar Cipher
Assignment 1: Word lengths
You will write a program to figure out the most common word length of words from a file. 
To solve this problem you will need to keep track of how many words from a file are of each possible length. 
You should group all words of length 30 or more together, and you should not count basic punctuation that are the first or last characters of a group of characters.
Assignment 2: Caesar Cipher Two Keys Decrypt
You should start by writing the decryption method explained in the lesson that decrypts a message that was encrypted with one key, using statistical letter frequencies of English text. 
Then you will add code to be able to decrypt a message that was encrypted with two keys, using ideas from the single key decryption method and the encryption with two keys method from 
the program you wrote in the last lesson.
