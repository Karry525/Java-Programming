Programming Exercise: Batch Grayscale and Image Inversion
Assignment 1: Word Play
You will write a program to transform words from a file into another form, such as replacing vowels with an asterix.
Assignment 2: Caesar Cipher
You will start with the Caesar Cipher algorithm you learned about in the videos, and you will make some enhancements to it, so that 
it works with all letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and to make it a little bit harder to decrypt.
