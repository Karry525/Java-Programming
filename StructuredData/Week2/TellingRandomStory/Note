Programming Exercise: Telling a Random Story

Assignment 1: Most Frequent Word
You will write a program to determine the word that occurs the most often in a file. If more than one word occurs as the most often, then
return the first such word found. You should make all words lowercase before counting them. Thus, “This” and “this” will both be counted 
as the lowercase version of “this”. You should not consider punctuation, so “end” and “end,” will be considered different words. Use the
WordFrequencies program in the lesson as a starting point.

Assignment 2: Character Names
Write a program to determine the characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays that have the most speaking parts.
