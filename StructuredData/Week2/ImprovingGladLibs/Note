Programming Exercise: Improving GladLibs

Assignment 1: Codon Count
Write a program to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA based on reading frames. A strand of DNA is made up of the
symbols C, G, T, and A. A codon is three consecutive symbols in a strand of DNA such as ATT or TCC. A reading frame is a way of dividing a
strand of DNA into consecutive codons. Consider the following strand of DNA = “CGTTCAAGTTCAA”.

Assignment 2: Words in Files
Write a program to determine which words occur in the greatest number of files, and for each word, which files they occur in.

Assignment 3: Maps Version of GladLibs
Start with your GladLibs program you completed earlier in this lesson. Make a copy of it and call it GladLibMap.java. Now modify this 
program to use one HashMap that maps word types to ArrayList of possible words to select. Your program should still work for the additional
categories verbs and fruits and should not use duplicate words from a category.
